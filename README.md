## Hello to anyone who is reading this.

Please do not judge the quality of this code AT ALL. Especially you, potential recruiters.
This is a web application that helps my roommates and I keep track of and pay bills.
I usually work on it when I am hanging out with them. Which typically means there is alcohol involved.
A lot of alcohol.
I'm not going to waste money on a private repo.

## TODO
1) User profile page (with editing)
2) Bill history
3) Alerting system when new bill is posted or paid
4) Admin ability to add bill types, deactivate users/bills
5) Integrate with PECO, PGW, Comcast?
