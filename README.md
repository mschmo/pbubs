## Hello to anyone who is reading this.

Please do not judge the quality of this code AT ALL. Especially you, potential recruiters.
This is a web application that helps my roommates and I keep track of and pay bills.
I usually work on it when I am hanging out with them. Which typically means there is alcohol involved.
A lot of alcohol.
I'm not going to waste money on a private repo.

## TODO
1) Add template theme
2) User profile page (with editing)
3) Post new bills
4) Bill history
5) Alerting system when new bill is posted or paid
6) Admin ability to add bill types, deactivate users/bills
7) Integrate with PECO, PGW, Comcast?
